                            <br>

                            <h3 class="mb-3">Advantages of Pursuing MBBS abroad:</h3>
                            <p class="para">Let’s first know and analyze the advantages of choosing to study Educare overseas.
</p><br>
<h3 class="mb-3">Global exposure:</h3>

                            <p class="para">You cannot gain and have an experience of varied exposure by just staying at your own place. If you notice, the person who keeps on traveling and exploring the world may have better exposure and knowledge than the one who never travels. Let me tell you another interesting thing, travel helps you make smarter and more creative. Similarly, students who pursue their education abroad gain valuable exposure, confidence and acquire hands-on experience in their attempts.

</p><br>
<p class="para">You may now think with global exposure, what am I able to do? The answer is it allows you to interact with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, values, and ethics, enabling you to establish stronger connections with patients from around the world.

</p><br>
<h3 class="mb-3">Low Tuition fee:</h3>

<p class="para">Many have a myth that studying MBBS abroad costs huge. But do you know what the real truth is? It is very much cheaper and more affordable when comparing it with pursuing MBBS in India. Choosing MBBS abroad is like the cherry on top for students, as the amount spent for a whole medical course overseas equals the cost of just one year's fees in India. You can complete your medical degree abroad at just INR 15 lakhs, this sounds great, right?

Opting to pursue your career in Medicine abroad with Indomed Educare offers you a wide range of options in choosing the most affordable country and also the colleges in the different parts of the country.
</p><br>

<h3 class="mb-3">English as the medium of instruction:</h3>

                            <p class="para">Consider yourself relocating to a new city for education, already there will be challenges awaits for you like adapting to a different culture and climate. Adding to this learning a new language entirely for educational purposes can make the situation even more challenging. To address this issue, many international colleges have opted for English as the medium of instruction, facilitating smoother learning for students.
</p><br>

                            <p class="para">Generally, students have a fundamental understanding of how to read, write and speak English. Therefore, the English medium of instruction allows students to learn more efficiently. Indomed Educare understands the issue thereby suggesting and helping the student to choose the country which opts for English as the medium of instruction. </p><br>


                            <h3 class="mb-3">More number of seats offered:</h3>

                            <p class="para">One of my friends dropped her dream of becoming a doctor and later she pursued some other degree, due to the factor of low number of medical seats offered by colleges in India. Many medical aspirants are losing their chances of becoming a doctor due to this reason. In spite of having the required knowledge and skills, students tend to lose their chances due to the low number of seats. 

</p><br>

<p class="para">Medicine study abroad provides a greater number of seats when compared to India. It offers a valuable opportunity to aspiring doctors who were unable to secure admission in India. I would definitely say that it provides a golden opportunity for students pursuing MBBS. Indomed Educare provides students with the knowledge of the availability of seats and makes their dream come true.

</p><br>
<h4 class="mb-3">Importance to Practical knowledge:</h4>
<p class="para"> In the process of learning to dance just observing others won’t make you excel in dancing. Same way, in the phase of acing to play tennis it doesn’t require knowledge of rules and observing other players. More than that practice and hands-on learning make you stand out with the guidance of professionals.

</p><br>
<p class="para"> Similarly, a profession like a doctor demands more practical knowledge than theory. Students who pursue MBBS foreign have access to this under the guidance of experienced professors. Equipped with proper practical knowledge, they can easily adapt to patients and approach issues with more precision. With the proper guidance of Indomed Educare students chose the colleges abroad which provide more importance to practical knowledge than theory part.

</h3>
                            <p class="para"> Earlier, we have e discussed the advantages of pursuing MBBS abroad now let’s see the challenges in pursuing MBBS abroad,

 </p><br>
 <br>
                            <h3 class="mb-3">Requirement of English proficiency test
</h3>

                            <p class="para">A few Countries like USA, Canada, and Australia may demand you to take English proficiency tests. The aim of the English proficiency test is to analyze and evaluate your English knowledge. Some of the English proficiency tests are the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Clearing these exams is important for Indian students aspiring to secure admission to their dream colleges.
</p><br>
<p class="para">But not every country demands the clearance of English proficiency tests, Some countries, including the Philippines, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Georgia, do not mandate the clearance of English proficiency tests. Students can use the opportunity to secure admission to colleges located in these countries and turn their dreams into reality. With Indomed Educare's expert guidance, students can choose a country that doesn't require English proficiency tests and pursue their studies smoothly.

</h3>

                            <p class="para">Every country has different climatic conditions based on their geographical location. But in India, we have moderate climatic conditions throughout the year due to the same geographical location of India. Many students may not be able to cope with the different climatic patterns at their initial stages of college. And later on, this may be used by the students and they get adapted to it.
</p><br>
<p class="para"> In this case, students can choose a country that has a similar climatic pattern to that of India. The Philippines has the same climatic pattern as India so students in more numbers tend to choose the country for this purpose. With Indomed Educare's assistance, students can explore the best colleges in the Philippines and gain insights into other countries that share a similar climate to India.
