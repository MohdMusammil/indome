                                        <span>The availability of a larger number of seats offered in medical colleges abroad is the main reason why students choose to <a href="https://indomededucare.com/study-mbbs-abroad.php">Study MBBS Abroad</a>. By comparing the number of seats offered abroad with India its obvious that the former offers more seats compared to the latter. This could be probably the main concern of the students. The unavailability of seats leads many deservingcandidates to lose their chances of getting admission.</span>
